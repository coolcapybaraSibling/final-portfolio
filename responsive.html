        <h2>0. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This webpage is to showcase my work for the Responsive Redesign assignment for CS1300. <br>
            In this assignment, I chose an existing website to analyse and redesign to improve 
            the website's usuability and accessibility across different types of viewing screens.

        <h2>1. Choosing a Website</h2>
        <p>For this assignment, I chose the website for Jaswell's Farm in nearby Smithfield, RI.</p>
        <p>Link to the website <a href="https://www.jaswellsfarm.com/">here</a></p>
        <p>
            (Disclaimer: one part of the Jaswell's Farm website to make apple picking reservations 
            stopped working while I was working on this assignment. Below the 2 pictures of the tractor
            and the blueberries, there was functionality to select the number of people and the date of the reservation, 
            both of which I included in my redesign. I'll lightly reference to this now-nonexistent part
            of the website.)
        </p>
        <br>
        <img src="assets/jaswells-before.png" alt="Screenshot of current Jaswell's website">
        <p>
            The reason I chose this website was because it is not responsive at all, and 
            the information on the website seems clunky and confusing.
        </p>
        <h3>Problems with Exsiting Website</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <h4>Usability</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The information after the "Welcome to Jaswell's Farm" banner may not
                        be that important to users (e.g. where the farm owners went to college).
                        This may distract and divert any users trying to make a reservation on the 
                        main page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Navigation bar covered by photos in the middle of the page, another nav bar
                        appears at the bottom of the page 
                    </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <h4>Learnability</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Navigation bar at top of screen helps new users easily go to other pages
                        of the website
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have to scroll all the way to bottom of the page to make a reservation
                        and finding hours of operation is in a big block of text,
                        may be hard to find for new users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Images in middle of website are actually photo galleries with multiple images,
                        arrows to show different images only appear if you hover over the images
                    </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <h4>Memorability</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The hierarchy may be confusing
                        for casual users. They may be confused at first if they can make a reservation
                        on the website since it's at the bottom. These users may expect clearer icons
                        or some big buttons/links to make the reservation. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
          <p>
            The current website also does not adjust to different screens well. For example,
            the nav bar doesn't turn into any sort of hamburger menu and the images do not
            scale with the viewport size.
          </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Accessibility</h4>
          <p>
            I agree with the WAVE report, which highlights contrast issues with some of the webpage text 
            and some links not having any text (e.g. Facebook and Instagram).
            Additionally, if you hover over two images in the page, it reveals multiple images 
            behind them which suggests a sort of gallery. This may not be noticeable by the user 
            and isnâ€™t accessible.

        <h2>2. Low-fi Redesign</h2>
        <p>
          In the first step of redesigning the Jaswell's Farm website, I made a set of
          low-fideilty wireframes for desktop, tablet, and phone use. These wireframes 
          show a responsive website design and address the issues I found with the existing
          website.

        <h2>3. Design Guide</h2>
        <p>
            Before making high-fidelity prototypes of the redesigned website, I first made
            a style design guide to establish the look of the interactive elements and components
            on the website.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Hi-fi Prototypes</h2>
        <p>
          I incorperated elements from the design guide when creating my high-fidelity prototypes.
          Annotations are included to indicate CSS that will be used to make the redesigned
          website look like the hifi designs.

          Finally, I used the hi-fi prototypes to create my website! <br>
