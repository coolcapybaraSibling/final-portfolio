        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to the design assignments in CS1300, I also worked on assignments focused
            on website functionality. I built a rudimentary bakery e-commerce website for this specific 
            assignment.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Many major e-commerce websites like Amazon and Target have functionality to
            show customers the items in their cart and the total cost of the cart's items.
        </p>
        <div class="item">
            <img src="./assets/amazon-cart.png">
            <figcaption>Online cart on amazon.com</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
            Users expect a list of items and total item of items due to existing e-commerce websites.
            For my website, I took into account existing user expectations to display a cart list and
            cart price for my bakery website.
        </p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          I used React, Javascript, and CSS to create the website. I was more focused on functionality,
          so the website's design is not refined. <br>
          In this assignment, I used React props and components to dynamically calculate and display
          the items in the cart and the cart's price.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
          My bakery website was a successful, yet basic attempt at emulating the online shopping
          experiences that are widely used in America. Several design and functionality features
          are not present, but I improve on these in my Development assignment, so be sure
          to check that out!
