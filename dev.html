        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This assignment is an expansion of the <a href="react_studio.html">bakery website I made eariler</a>.
            <br>
            Requirements for this assignment involve using React to add new functionality, such as
            filtering items based on different qualities.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            My previous bakery e-commerce website was usable and functional, but it did not look
            visually appealing.
        </p>
        <div class="item">
            <img src="./assets/react-img.png">
            <figcaption>Not the best-looking...</figcaption>
        </div>
        <p>
            I planned on making much-needed visual changes in addition to adding the required sorting
            and filtering functions for this assignment. The new website needed to be able to allow the
            user to filter the bakery items for specific qualities (e.g. French items), as well as sort the 
            items based on a numeric metric like price.
        </p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>  
          I used the same frameworks (React, CSS) as the React studio. For this assignment, 
          I used Material UI components to implement the sorting and filtering functions.
          <br>
          For filtering, I used Material UI checkboxes so the user can choose the filters applied.
          I included a Radio button set to sort the bakery items by price. In the future, I could add 
          more buttons so users can sort items using different metrics.
          <br> <br>
          I used CSS Grid to display the bakery items in an organized way.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
          I'm happy with the improvements I made from the old bakery website. I didn't have time
          to figure out how to line up all the filters and sort buttons, so there's still some work 
          the website could use.
