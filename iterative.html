        <p>Iteratively Designing a Product's Interface</p>

        <h2>01. Picking a Startup</h2>
        <p>
          In this demo we will be designing a product's interface from scratch
          for a company whose product we have not seen. The criteria for our
          selection is as follows:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>The company must be in an accelerator class of 2022.</li>
          <li>
            The company's product must be centered around a digital interface.
          </li>
          <li>The company must have a clear purpose and view.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Keeping the above critera in mind we decided to design an interface
          for the company Roomkast!
          <br />
          As stated in their profile on Techstars.com:
          <br />
          Roomkast is a profile-matching tool for people who see the value in
          co-sharing a place to live.

        <h2>02. Sketching & Wireframing</h2>
        <p>
          To begin, each member of our team created a set of low fidelity
          wireframes detailing what we imagined the interface to look like,
          without any input from our peers.

                  The first member of our group incorporated apartment preference into the roommate search. 
                  Users would first find an apartment that they liked first and would then reach out to potential housements 
                  interested in the same apartment.

                <p style="font-size: 1em;">
                  The second member of our group focused on developing a platform that would algorithmically determine 
                  compatibility between users after you create your profile. This platform was only created to match users based 
                  on their living style preferences and had no consideration for potential apartments.

                <p style="font-size: 1em;">
                  The third member of our group created a survey that users were required to fill out before they 
                  could interact with other on the platform. This survey algorithmically determined compatibility 
                  and once completed, allowed users to see people they had a high chance of living well with.

                <p style="font-size: 1em;">The fourth member of our group considered the ability to create both individual and group profiles. 
                  This solution addresses how, for example, if there are three people who know they want to live together 
                  and are considering a four-bedroom apartment, they can enter Roomkast as a group seeking one more roommate.

        <h2>03. Mockups</h2>
        <p>
          We can now use our low-fidelity wireframes as a reference for a
          high-fidelity mockup. Here is our first draft:
        </p>

        <iframe
          style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"
          width="100%"
          height="650"
          src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FV5rOaQxzhf2xwopQYw1t1D%2FMockup-Before-Critique%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1"
          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>

        <p>We incorporated these interaction principles in our high-fidelity mockup:</p>
        <h3>Interaction</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean, appealing color scheme and text font</li>
            <li>High-contrast button design</li>
            <li>Dropdown menu in Messages screen with different message sort options (e.g. compatibility)</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Navigation</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Included navigation bar with text and intuitive icons to access different screens</li>
            <li>"Back" buttons on screens to go back to another screen</li>
            <li>Left/right arrows and "Next" buttons in the preferences survey</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Blue banners on top of screens with relevant text in bold</li>
            <li>Profiles display users' budget range and location at top of profile along with match percentage</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          To help improve our design we sought feedback from our peers and an
          industry professional. Some of the feedback we received was:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a different icon for Messages button in navigation bar</li>
          <li>Have a start screen for preferences survey after creating an account</li>
          <li>Insert more feedback here</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After incorporating the feedback given to us we had the following
          design:

        <h2>04. User Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Although we were happy with the mockup we had at the time, we sought
          to improve our design even more by incorporating user testing! User
          testing is when you have someone use the interface/product that you
          have created and give feedback and suggestions about your design. To
          accomplish this we used the platform
          <a href="usertesting.com">UserTesting</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each of our users, we gave them the following task: <br>
          Imagine you’re a young professional looking to share an apartment
          with a roommate to cut down on rent. Create an account and 
          find a potential roommate you would like to chat with. 
        </p>
        <p>Specific steps to complete the task:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Select a login method and create an individual profile. </li>
          <li>Follow the prompts to create an account. </li>
          <li>
            Next, look through the potential housemate candidates – 
            you can interact with the discovery page and look at their profiles. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Before you check your messages, reach out to Amelia (a potential housemate) 
            by sending her a message. 
          </li>
          <li>After you send your message to Amelia, pin her conversation in the messages tab.</li>
          <li>Lastly, sort the conversations by compatibility.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Let's view the results!
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li> User 1 had trouble sending the message to Amelia since the text and button disappeared. Additionally, he had trouble pinning Amelia’s conversation in the “Messages”
            tab since sliding to reveal the pin and the pressing to pin the conversation was a bit unintuitive. Lastly, this user had an issue with sorting by compatibility 
            as he found the button to be very small and not noticeable. 
          </li>
        </ul>
          <p> User 1's written response to questions</p>
        <ul> 
          <li> Would you like to see more, less, or the same information on the cards on the discovery screen? Which elements would you like to see added or removed?</li> 
            <ul>
              <li>  "Absolutely the same - I’d remove elements on messages screen which show preview message" </li>
            </ul>
           
          <li>  What did the bookmark shaped icon below each profile indicate to you? </li>
            <ul> 
             <li> "That it would highlight what my preferences were and those that I want to short list. It would be good if that person was also notified that I’d bookmarked them" </li>

          <li> What do you think about the design of the app? </li>  
            <ul>

            </ul>
           
          <li>  What did the bookmark shaped icon below each profile indicate to you? </li>
            <ul>

            The message sending, pinning, and sorting tasks were unintuitive, as she was unable to complete these actions.  
          </li>
        </ul>
          <p> User 3's written response to questions</p>
        <ul> 
          <li> Would you like to see more, less, or the same information on the cards on the discovery screen? Which elements would you like to see added or removed?</li> 
            <ul>
              <li>  "Everything just needs to be a lot more clearer" </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

              " </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>   
        <p>The main issues regarding user experience were 1) the message to Amelia did not appear correctly, leading to some confusion and 2) 
          the pinning interaction was not responsive and ultimately confusing. Users also experienced issues with needing to scroll on their phones 
          to see the entire screen (leading to issues seeing buttons if they were hidden at the bottom of a page). Generally, users enjoyed the cleanliness 
          of the design coupled with the fonts and colors chosen. Additionally, all three users believed that they were able to complete the task successfully 
          and rated the easiness of the task as a ⅘.

          In response to the feedback we received from our user testing, we fixed the issue with messaging Amelia, this time ensuring that the 
          message and send button were both visible on the wireframe. With regards to pinning, we determined that because users were using iPhones 
          during these tests, the interaction on Figma did not go through correctly – when we tested the interaction on our desktops, we were able 
          to complete the task successfully. Thus, we request users to use a desktop when interacting with the prototype. Additionally, we made the 
          “sort by” button on the “Messages” tab larger so that users could find it more easily <br><br>

          In future iterations, we will adjust the scrolling issue to make each page more responsive to varying screen sizes. Additionally, 
          we will flush out other interactions such as archiving and deleting messages.
